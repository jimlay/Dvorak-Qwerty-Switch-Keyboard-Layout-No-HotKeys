Windows 10 and Windows 11 make it impossible to have both Dvorak and
Qwerty keyboards if you're a developer because the layout switching
hotkeys always get randomly ran when switching tabs or using vim.

I check this repository out on my desktop and add the shortcuts DVORAK
and QWERTY to my start bar and then it's easy to switch back and forth
but never have it happen on accident.
